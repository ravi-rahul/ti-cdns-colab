Cadence Torrent PHY
-----------------------

Required properties:
- compatible:	cdns,torrent-phy-t0
- clocks:	Must contain an entry in clock-names.
		See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names:	Must be "phy_clk"
- resets:	Must contain an entry for each in reset-names.
		See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names:	Must include "torrent_reset" and "torrent_apb".
		"torrent_reset" must control the reset line to the PHY.
		"torrent_apb" must control the reset line to the APB PHY
		interface.
		interface ("torrent_apb" is optional).
- reg:		register range for the PHY.
- #address-cells: Must be 2
- #size-cells:	Must be 2

Sub-nodes:
  Each group of PHY lanes with a single master lane should be represented as
  a sub-node. Note that the actual configuration of each lane is determined by
  hardware strapping, and must match the configuration specified here.

Sub-node required properties:
- #phy-cells:	Generic PHY binding; must be 0.
- cdns,mlane:	The master lane number.  This is the lowest numbered lane
		in the lane group.
- resets:	Must contain one entry which controls the reset line for the
		master lane of the sub-node.
		See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- cdns,num-lanes:	Number of lanes in this group.  From 1 to 4.  The
			group is made up of consecutive lanes.
- cdns,phy-type:	Can be PHY_TYPE_PCIE or PHY_TYPE_USB3 or PHY_TYPE_DP, depending on
			configuration of lanes.

For PHY_TYPE_DP max-bit-rate property is required: 
- cdns,max-bit-rate: The maximum bit rate


Example:
	pcie_phy4: pcie-phy@fd240000 {
		compatible = "cdns,torrent-phy-t0";
		reg = <0x0 0xfd240000 0x0 0x40000>,
		      <0x00 0xfd242000 0x0 0x10>;
		resets = <&phyrst 0>, <&phyrst 1>;
		reset-names = "torrent_reset", "torrent_apb";
		clocks = <&phyclock>;
		clock-names = "phy_clk";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		usb_phy0: usb-phy {
				cdns,mlane = <0>;
				resets = <&phyrst 2>;
				cdns,num-lanes = <2>;
				#phy-cells = <0>;
				cdns,phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_USB3>;
		};
		dp_phy0: dp-phy {
				cdns,mlane = <0>;
				resets = <&phyrst 4>;
				cdns,num-lanes = <1>;
				cdns,max-bit-rate = <5400>;
				#phy-cells = <0>;
				cdns,phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_DP>;
		};
	}
